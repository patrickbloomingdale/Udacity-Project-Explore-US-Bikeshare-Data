# Udacity-Project-Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Project 2, Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

***

## Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Rubric

### Code Quality
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Functionality of code|  All code cells can be run without error.  |
|  Choice of data types and structures|  Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.  |
|  Use of loops and conditional statements|  Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.  |
|  Use of packages|  Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.  |
|  Use of functions|  Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.  |
|  Use of good coding practices|  Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.  |

### Script and Questions
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Solicit and handle raw user input  |  Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered. |
|  Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.  |  Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.  |
